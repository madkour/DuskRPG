Licenses

Last update: 1/4/2013

**NOTE**Dusk's sourcecode is GPL, and any art Dusk used back in the day is also GPL.  I've included "img" folder with proper licenses because I plan to use those tiles in Dusk.

Note: The licensing of the allacrost's files is assumed to be GPLv2 or later, as told on the allacrost web site: http://www.allacrost.org

'OGA' stands for: Open Game Art - http://opengameart.org
